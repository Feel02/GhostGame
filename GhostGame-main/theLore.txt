Wendy and Andy, siblings who lost their parents in a tragic incident, survived together in a forest of mysterious creatures. Wendy became kind and cozy, while Andy's hatred for humans grew. Despite their differences, they loved and protected each other.

One day, they went to the flower fields to pick flowers for their parents' grave. When they returned home, they discovered that all the nearby trees had been cut down. Enraged, Andy sought out the person responsible, a woodman. Andy killed the woodman out of his deep hatred. Wendy arrived too late to stop him.

Andy proposed that they unite and fight against humans, willing to kill innocent townspeople. Wendy, unable to harm the innocent, realized Andy had become mad and chose to separate from him. Despite the separation, they still loved each other.

They both came up with a solution: collecting the magical stars. Every decade, on a special night, five stars would fall into the dark forest. The one who collected the most stars could make any wish come true. They eagerly awaited that night, and the day awaited them as well.
